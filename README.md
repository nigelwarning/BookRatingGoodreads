# Where is my rating based on?
- Movie Skills: Acting skills, visuals, soundtrack. So all the work behind the movie. 
- Story: How do I like the story? Do I like the story? Is it well paced? Do I like the choices of the writers?
- Enjoyment: How much did I like this movie? I tend to give a B-movie a lower note, but sometimes we enjoy 'so bad it is good movies' So when I enjoy a bad movie, this rating will give a bit better rating.
- Own Rating: My own rating
- Letterboxd Rating: The Letterboxd rating of the movie.
